Blare provides alternatives views of the data that's in Aware. The API requests and queries are prerequisites to get [Orbit](https://github.com/jwogrady/orbit), [Apex](https://github.com/jwogrady/apex), [Epic](https://github.com/jwogrady/epic) and [Oasis](https://github.com/jwogrady/oasis) projects to a 1.0 release.

Aware provides a solid customer centric view of our client base, so we don't need to create that experience. The aim of Blare is to create alternaitive views of our customer base that will help streamline our publishing, support, and sales workflows. For example, Aware users can quickly pull a list of domains, a list of customers subscribed to a particular service, and a lot more.

We call this project Blare because we use `BL`esta API calls to pull data out of Aw`ARE`.
